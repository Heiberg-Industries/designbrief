# Handoff

> Last Updated: 2026-02-20

## Current Focus

All planned phases complete (1, 2, 2b). Ready for npm publish once package name is resolved.

## Next Priority

1. Resolve package name (TBD in package.json) — blocked by ibelick/ui-skills conflict
2. Phase 3: MCP server — palette generation, contrast checking, token export, Tailwind config
3. Phase 4: Artifact generation — W3C DTCG design tokens, Tailwind configs, CSS custom properties per style

## Recently Completed

| Date | What |
|------|------|
| 2026-02-20 | Phase 2b: Added Freeform style (21st style — meta-guardrails for personal expression) |
| 2026-02-20 | Phase 2: npm package, CLI installer (bin/cli.js), GitHub Action, skills.sh/skild.sh support |
| 2026-02-20 | Updated CLAUDE.md with Task Fidelity Routing, session continuity docs |
| 2026-02-18 | Phase 1: 5 new sections across all 20 styles (Dark Mode, Responsive, Content & Voice, Icons, Accessibility) |
| 2026-02-18 | Enhanced Do's/Don'ts with "why" explanations across all styles |
| 2026-02-18 | Updated _index.md with dark mode/accessibility/responsive/density metadata |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| MIT license | Changed from PolyForm Noncommercial for broader adoption | 2026-02 |
| Guardrails over specs | Define aesthetic DNA, not pixel-perfect values — two projects using the same style should look related but not identical | 2026-02 |
| Glassmorphism as quality reference | Manually written first, then used as benchmark for all other style expansions | 2026-02 |
| Renaming deferred | Conflict with ibelick/ui-skills (835 stars) — revisit later | 2026-02 |
| Package name TBD | Awaiting resolution of naming conflict before npm publish | 2026-02 |

## On Hold

- Renaming — conflict with existing ibelick/ui-skills repo (835 stars)
- npm package name — blocked by naming decision
